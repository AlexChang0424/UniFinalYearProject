Project Title

IoT based Hydroponic Deep-Water Culture (DWC) Monitoring System and Plant Condition Prediction using CNN

Projetc Involed

Internet of Things and Machine Learning Implementation

Project Objectives 

i.  To create and build a cost-efficient, indoor-suitable prototype hydroponic monitoring system.

ii. To integrate the Internet of Things sensors on the system to measure the water's nutritional content, temperature, and air humidity & temperature.

iii.To integrate a machine learning-based system to predict the health and growth rate of the hydroponic plants.

iv. To have a cloud database to house the sensors data from IoT sensors and machine learning-based system, then display the data on an interactive dashboard.
